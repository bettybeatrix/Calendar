Im so happy talaga na nakilala mo sila and nakapag-usap pa kayo kahit saglit lang. Sobrang kinakabahan pa ko nung una huhu I know mabait sila pero ewan ko ba, kinakabahan talaga ko.

I love youu so muchh. Kaso ayun, not so perfect ang araw today kasi Friday the 13th huhu naiiyak talaga ko sa phone ko, di pa kami nakapag dinner kaloka. Stress na stress kami lahat kasi ang shunga ko kainis, wala na tuloy akong phone ngayon huhu ang hirap ng ganto, iniisip ko na lang baka may purpose to and it’s just a material thing. Nakakastress talaga pero buti na lang nandiyan ka.

                "Ang hirap talaga mag-message gamit lang laptop huhu sobrang miss na kita and ang bigat sa pakiramdam na wala akong phone kaiyaq di ako makalaro. Naiisip ko pa na baka matagalan bago mapalitan, kaya kung ano ano iniisip ko.  Pano kung hindi na ako makapag chat like before? What if may magchat sayo gaya ng ginawa ko dati nung kinukulit kita? What if mabored ka  tapos nireplyan mo? What if magustuhan mo? Ayoko naaa huhu kainis di ko maiwasan. Alam kong hindi dapat ganto iniisip ko kasi I know you and you wouldn't do such things pero kasi eh huhu hirap magpigil kapikon. Lalo pa ngayon wala naman tayong pasok kaya di rin tayo magkasama. Sana matapos na agad ‘tong phase na ‘to pls pls. I love you so much mahal ko. I trust you, and I’ll keep reminding myself na we’ll get through this kahit mahirap.

                "I just realized na lahat ng photos ko sa phone wala na talaga huhu ang sakit sa heart kasi ang dami kong tinatago secretly na photos mo for this countdown ng messages ko, pero wala na silang lahat. Nakakawalang gana, parang ayoko na ituloy to, charing. Buti na lang may pasok na bukas kaya makikita na kita, yeheyy! Pero prank muna, kunwari hindi ako papasok, papansin lang.

One hour pa akong naghintay, nakakafrustrate talaga. Parang ang dami nangyayari lately na nakakainis. Buti na lang nandiyan ka mahal. Sobrang thankful ako kasi kahit ang gulo ng araw ko, you still made it better. Every time na kasama kita, nawawala bigla yung bigat sa dibdib ko. Sobrang lucky ko talaga sayo, ang pogi na, very calming pa. Thank you for always being there for me mahal, kahit gaano kagulo yung araw ko you always find a way to make me smile. Love na love na love kita! 20 days na lang yeheyy",

Thank you for being so patient saakin mahal, for always understanding even when I’m at my lowest, and for reassuring me when I start to overthink.

                "I'm happy na we fixed things before tayo magsleep, pero I still have been thinking what happened earlier. I'm really sorry for making you feel that way mahal. I never want you to feel ignored or unimportant, you are my priority, and I love you so much mahal ko. I'm so grateful na you opened up to me kanina, I know it wasn’t easy for you, lalo na its about overthinking. Thank you mahal for sharing your thoughts and feelings, it takes so much courage and I really appreciate it love.  I want you to know that whatever is on your mind, you can always talk to me about it mahal. I will always listen kasi I want to understand you better and make sure you feel secure in us. I know overthinking sometimes makes you feel bad, and thats okay. It’s a part of you, and it doesn’t change how much I love you. I admire how self-aware you are mahal about it, and I see how much you’re trying to improve for us. That’s such a beautiful thing about you love, you never stop growing, and you’re always honest with me. Please don’t hate that side of yours mahal. It’s not something you have to face alone because I’m here for you. We’ll get through it together, always. Mahal na mahal kita sobra and i will also do my part to make things better. I know I’ve been busy and sometimes late magreply, but I promise to be more mindful mahal. I’ll try harder to reassure you so you don’t feel that way again. You are too precious to me kaya it hurts me even more pag nasasaktan kita. What happens today made me realize just how lucky I am to have you. I love you so much mahal. Goodnight po. I wish I could hug you right now and remind you in person how much I love you and how important you are to me. 10 days na lang love, I'm so excited na to see you ulit. Miss na miss na miss na kita",
                "Hi lovey, I'm just a little upset today kasi I'm planning and I was really looking forward to spend some time with you kaso di natuloy huhu nagpaalam na ko nakaraan na mag isa na lang ako bibili ng gifts para magpapasama na lang ako sayo, pinayagan naman ako tapos ngayon biglang sabay sabay na raw kami. I really wanted to be with you today huhu miss na miss na talaga kita. Alam mo ba love, kanina pa ako nag-iisip about how much I miss you. I just want to see you, hold your hand, and spend even just a little time with you. Parang kulang kasi talaga pag wala ka huhu di ko na kaya maddeds na q. I know we’ll see each other soon, but ang hirap lang minsan maghintay lalo na kapag ganito, gusto kita kasama pero hindi pwede. Gusto kong bumawi sayo mahal, sana magkita na tayo pls pls. I love you so much mahal ko. Thank you for being so patient and understanding kahit na minsan feeling ko ang kulit and super maldita ko. Mahal na mahal kita lovey, 9 days na lang we'll meet na talaga",
                "Hi loveey, so daming nangyari today huhu I'm so pagod na. I'm glad sinunod kita na magsstay sa color ng bracket ko kasi pag uwi ko sabi ng pinsan ko bagay raw sakin, same color lang naman last time pero bakit ba uto uto ako eh. Kanina love nung nasa esplanade kami lalong tumindi pangungulila ko sayo huhu I just remember yung last time na magkasama tayo don, it felt so different pag wala ka mahal, masyado akong nasanay kasama ka, how I wish kasama kita sa lahat. Oh, and mahal, our conversation about having kids kanina? huhu ang saya lang. That topic really gives me life. Ang cute cute ng idea na someday magkakaron tayo ng sarili nating family. Super happy rin ng heart ko thinking na ikaw yung magiging partner ko in building my dreams. I'll always pray for us mahal and I promise to do everything to make sure that we’ll end up together. I love you so much mahal ko, ikaw na yung gusto kong makasama when I grow up and and I’ll never stop choosing you every single day. I’m so sure about you love. You’re my home, my safe place, and my everything. Mahal na mahal kita sobra, 8 days na lang mahal ko we'll celebrate your 20's na, I'm so exciteddd",
                "I wanna be honest with you mahal kasi ang bigat na ng pakiramdam ko today. I miss you so much, and it’s starting to get to me. Hindi ko alam kung bakit ganto. Dati kaya ko naman kahit one to three months pa walang kita kita. Pero ngayon, wala pang two weeks, parang gusto ko na umiyak. I’m so frustrated mahal. Naiinis ako sa sarili ko kasi hindi naman ako ganito dati. Ang clingy ko na, and I hate feeling this way. But at the same time, naiinis din ako sayo mahal, kahit alam kong wala ka namang ginagawang mali. I’ve been giving hints na kasi that I really want to see you, na gusto ko magkita tayo, pero parang wala lang. It hurts kasi I feel like I’m the only one who’s desperate for us to be together. Alam ko naman na hindi ganon, pero ganto yung nararamdaman ko love, and I don’t know how to stop it. I love you so much mahal, and maybe that’s why it’s so hard for me now. I just miss you terribly. I want to see you, hug you, and be with you. Parang ang lungkot ng araw ko without you, and I’m struggling to handle it. I hope you understand where im coming from mahal. I’m not saying this to make you feel bad or para mapressure ka, I just want to be honest with how I’m feeling lang. Mahal kita sobra, and I know we’ll see each other soon. Pero ang hirap lang talaga minsan, lalo na pag ganito. I love you so much  mahal ko. Goodnight po.",
                "Today has been so hard for me, and I just want to let everything out. I’m feeling so many things at once, confused, miserable, and lonely. I don’t even know if I’m really upset with you or if it’s just my hormones kasi I have my period na. Ang bigat lang ng lahat, and I feel like everything is crashing down at the same time. Kanina I overheard yung usapan nila papa about sa condition ni mama. Alam ko naman na may sakit si mama and that it’s been getting worse, pero hearing them talk about it made everything feel so real. Ang hirap kasi she’s always been strong, kahit pa hirap na siya. Parang ang bigat lang na tanggapin. Kahapon pa maga mata ko kakaiyak, and now it’s even worse. I feel so helpless mahal, like I can’t do anything to make things better for her or for myself. Tapos naiisip ko pa na baka maging pabigat na lang ako sayo. Ang dami kong iniinda, ang dami kong dalahin, and I feel like maybe you deserve someone who doesn’t have this much baggage. But then mahal, I love you so much. I don’t want to lose you. I don’t want to give up on us just because life is hard right now. I’m really sorry if I’ve been distant or if my emotions have been all over me. Alam ko hindi mo kasalanan, and you’ve been nothing but loving and understanding saakin. I just hope you can be patient with me as I try to figure this out. Sana gumaling na si mama. Sana umayos na lahat. I know this coming new year is supposed to be a fresh start, pero right now it feels so heavy and lonely. I’ll keep praying for better days to come. Thank you for being here mahal. You’re my strength even when everything feels so overwhelming. I love you so much, and I hope you know how much you lessen all of my frustrations by just listening to me, it helps me a lot mahal. Thank you",
                "Happy New Year, my love! I'm very thankful talaga nakilala kita and look how far we've come.  Grabe mahal, parang nung last year nag aasaran lang tayo. Hindi ko inexpect na yung ganong asaran natin would turn into something this beautiful. I’m so thankful na nag risk tayo sa isa’t isa. Kung hindi for sure magiging isa ‘to sa biggest regret and what if's ko. This year was so wonderful because of you. Ikaw yung naging dahilan kung bakit kahit ang bigat minsan ng life ko nakakaya ko pa rin. You never failed to make me feel loved, valued, and special. Even sa mga araw na I'm not at my best or hindi ko nakikita yung sarili kong maganda or deserving. That means so much to me mahal. Ang sarap lang sa pakiramdam na ikaw yung kasama ko sa lahat ng ups and downs ng taon na ‘to. Kahit nung mga araw na hirap ako, hindi mo ako iniwan. You’ve always been there, patiently loving me and supporting me in ways no one else ever has. You’re my safe space, my home, and my happiness mahal. I thank God everyday kasi binigay ka niya sakin. You’re truly the greatest blessing he has given me. Through you, naramdaman ko yung kind of love na sobrang genuine and pure. You’ve shown me what it means to be deeply cared for, and I promise na ipaparamdam ko rin sa’yo yon every single day. I know this year will bring challenges, pero alam ko rin na kaya natin silang harapin together. Thank you for being the best man for me mahal. You’re everything I prayed for and more. I’m so proud of you and so grateful for all the love you’ve given me. I can’t wait to spend another year with you mahal ko. Let’s continue to grow together and build the beautiful future we both dream of. I love you so much my love. Mahal na mahal na mahal kita",
                "Happy New Year ulit lovey! This is officially our first day of the year together, and I just want to start it by telling you how much I love and appreciate you. Ang sarap sa pakiramdam na ikaw yung kasama ko sa panibagong year na ‘to love. Parang ang daming pwedeng mangyari this year, nakakatakot pero knowing na kasama kita makes me at ease. I’ve been reflecting a lot lately and every time I think about last year, naaalala ko kung pano ka naging light and strength ko sa mga days na nahihirapan ako. You were there in my happiest and hardest moments, and you made everything so much better just by being you. Ang dami mong nagawa para sakin na hindi mo siguro napapansin, pero it means a lot to me. I will do my best this year mahal to be better, not just for myself, but for us din. Ang saya lang isipin na this year, we’re building more memories, more laughter, and more love. I’m so excited for what’s ahead, whether it’s simple moments or big milestones. Lahat ng yon mahal, I hope kasama kita. Thank you for being my person, my safe place, and my everything. I’m so grateful na ikaw yung kasama ko ngayon at sa mga susunod pa. You make life so much sweeter, and I can’t wait to see what this year has in store for us.  Mahal na mahal kita, and I’ll continue to love you more and more each day. Lapit na birthday ng baby ko, yeheyyy!",
                "I know we both agreed to sleep early tonight, but honestly, it's one of the hardest nights for me. Im crying myself to sleep kasi i felt so heavy, so confused, and so upset. I want to open up to you because this has been building up since last week, and I feel like if I don’t share it, I’ll just keep hurting. I’ve been feeling so sad because I miss you so much. It’s not just the usual “I miss you”, it’s this deep longing to see you, to be with you, and to feel your presence again. Alam ko na dapat naiintindihan ko yung situation natin, pero this time it feels different, like there’s this emptiness inside me. Sobrang nasanay ako sayo, sa attention mo, sa presence mo, kaya ngayon parang hindi ko kayang hindi ka makita. I tried to give hints mahal, na gusto kitang makita, pero parang hindi mo napapansin or baka busy ka lang din. Then, when I said nagtatampo ako and you thought it was just my period, it made me feel worse. I know it’s my fault for not explaining my feelings earlier, pero I felt like hindi ako naiintindihan. I know you didn’t mean it in a bad way, pero ang bigat lang ng pakiramdam ko mahal. I’m really sorry for being cold and for letting my emotions get the better of me. I’m not mad at you love, I’m just overwhelmed by everything I’m feeling. I don’t want to be like this, and I don’t want to make you feel bad. I just hope na maintindihan mo how much I miss you and how much this distance is affecting me. I love you so much mahal ko. I know we can get through this, but I just need you to know how I feel. I hope we can talk about this soon because I don’t want us to go to sleep with heavy hearts again. Goodnight mahal. I’ll always love you, no matter what.",
